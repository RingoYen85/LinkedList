Things I needed to change(during troubleshooting) to get code to work:

1) need to decrement size after deleting node
2) need to update curr to curr -> next in the delete method otherwise list just stays stuck
3) needed to use out_of_range exception
4) need to define constructors for node class
5) needed to explicitly define NULL for some inputs to nodes
6) need to have getsize be a const method.
7) curr->data can be a T& reference.
